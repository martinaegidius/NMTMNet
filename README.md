# NMTMNet
Repository for the implementation of the Non-Markovian Transmembrane Net, a model trained on the DeepTMHMM data-set. The tasks of the project are:
1. Classify proteins with respect to membrane topology (alpha-transmembrane, alpha-transmembrane with signal peptide, signal peptide, globular protein and beta-barrels)
2. Generate per-residue topology predictions (Inside cell, part of signal peptide, cytosolic domain, part of alpha-helix (transmembrane), part of beta-barrel (transmembrane)
